<h1>Verifying The CDE Scope</a> <a </a></h1>
Here's how I verified the CDE scope:

I had initiated communication with stakeholders such as Software Developers, System Administrators, and Accounting. I'd requested essential documents like System Design Documents (SDDs), Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs), and Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) to understand data flow within the CDE. Additionally, I inquired about existing security controls and any relevant industry regulations or security standards impacting the CDE, like PCI DSS.

Taking the helm as the project lead, I convened a team meeting. During this meeting, I'd collaborated with team members to leverage their expertise while assigning roles for a GAP analysis based on individual strengths.Â We established a clear communication strategy for regular updates, using a communication platform such as Basecamp. Additionally, I considered utilizing project management tools to track progress, deadlines, and dependencies.

Finally, I drafted and presented a Project Charter to the CISO outlining the verified scope of the CDE, assigned roles and responsibilities, project timeline, and the expected delivery date for the completed GAP analysis by the team.
